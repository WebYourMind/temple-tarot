  query: `## Query Submission
  Start by submitting a query or a question you seek guidance for. It could be about anything that's on your mind—whether it's love, career, personal growth, or even day-to-day decisions.`,
  deck: `## Choosing a deck
  There are the 3 decks to choose from, 2 classic decks; The Rider Waite deck and Aleister Crowley's Thoth deck, and the Toth 2.0 deck based on Crowley's deck with updated themes.`,
  spread: `## Spread Selection
  Choose a tarot spread that suits your needs. Each spread focuses on different aspects of life, providing specific insights depending on your query.`,
  physical: `## Using your own cards
  If you prefer to use your own physical cards for a reading, Temple Tarot can help with the interpretation.`,
  cards: `## Card Selection Process
Here’s how it works:

### Step 1: Initial Split
- The Tarot deck starts as a whole and is then split into two halves.
- **Your task**: Feel intuitively whether your card is in the **Left Half** or the **Right Half** of the deck.

### Step 2: Select Your Half
- After you decide which half feels right, that half is chosen and the other half is discarded.
- This chosen half is then split again into new left and right sections.

### Step 3: Repeat the Selection
- Continue the process of selecting between the left and right halves.
- Each time you choose, the unselected half is discarded, and the remaining cards are split again.

### Final Step: Single Card Selection
- This selection process is repeated until you are left with just one card.
- Once only one card remains, you’ll then choose the orientation of your card.`,
  orientation: `## Choosing Orientation
- Decide the orientation of your final card as being either **Upright** or **Reversed**.
- Note: You won't know the actual orientation until the card is revealed after your selection.

This method ensures that the card and its orientation are selected not by sight but through your intuition, enhancing the personal connection and relevance of the reading.`,
